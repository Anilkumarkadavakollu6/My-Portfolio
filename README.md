# My-Portfolio
I created a responsive and interactive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases my skills, projects, education, and contact details in a clean and visually appealing layout. CSS was used for styling and animations, while JavaScript added interactivity such as a dynamic project section, smooth scrolling, and a responsive navigation menu. The website is fully mobile-friendly and designed to provide a professional first impression.
